Problem Statement:

Customer preservation is essential in a variety of businesses as acquiring new customers is often
costlier than keeping the current ones. Many companies are therefore always trying to answer the
question “How can we predict the value of a customer over the course of his or her interactions
with the business”. Santander therefore wants to know future customer transaction predictions.

Company overview

Banco Santander, S.A. is a Spanish multinational commercial bank and financial services
company founded and based in Santander, Spain. Their mission is to help promote businesses
and people by helping them understand their financial status and how best to achieve their
monetary goals. Santander is presently working on how to accelerate its digital transformation
and platform strategy to boost growth and increase profitability.
One of these transformations is to identify which customers will make at least one single
transaction in the future irrespective of the amount.
This question can best be answered by using predictive analysis of the customer past interactive
data with the company and then a machine learning model is used to predict the possibility of
these customers being retained or lost.
From these predictions, the company will know how much more efforts they need to keep the old
customers which could be through bonuses and discounts, special coupons, better customer
services and many more. While also thinking of how to attract more customers into the business
through marketing campaigns, offer more discounts and deals, online adverts etc
